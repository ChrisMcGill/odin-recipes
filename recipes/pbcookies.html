                <li>Measure the peanut butter and sugar into a bowl. Add Â¼ tsp fine table salt and mix well with a wooden spoon. Add the egg and mix again until the mixture forms a dough.</li>
                <li>Break off cherry tomato sized chunks of dough and place, well spaced apart, on the trays. Press the cookies down with the back of a fork to squash them a little. The cookies can now be frozen for 2 months, cook from frozen adding an extra min or 2 to the cooking time.</li>
